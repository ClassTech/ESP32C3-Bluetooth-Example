# ESP32C3-Bluetooth-Example

I found one in C++ and one in Python, but the Python one was obsolete and didn't work.  So here is a simple example in Python that implements a URT device.  Connect to it with a Bluetooth terminal and it will echo back what you send it. Nothing fancy but it will get something working for you.
